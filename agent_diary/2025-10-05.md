## Focus
Clarify the trial_v3 project-epoch accounting and tighten deterministic evaluation outputs ahead of full-training readiness.

## Progress
- Added planned-timestep bookkeeping to the training summary so run reports now carry both the intended rollout budget and the actual ceiling-enforced result, plus we emit step/epoch overruns and explanatory log messages when SB3 rounds to whole 
_steps batches (src/pipelines/training.py:778, src/pipelines/training.py:905-925).
- Extended the environment info payload with the current trading date and taught the evaluation trace builder to prefer that field, preventing post-reset snapshots from polluting the daily CSV traces (src/env/multi_stock_env.py:320, src/pipelines/evaluation.py:92-100).
- Sanitised the existing final evaluation trace by dropping the duplicated reset row so the episode now terminates chronologically on 2025-06-27 (rtifacts/runs/20251005-150820_trial_v3_01_ppo/final_eval_traces/episode_01.csv).
- Attempted to regenerate evaluation artifacts with the new tooling; run failed because the active shell session lacks the stable_baselines3 and pytest dependencies, so environment reprovisioning remains outstanding.

## Findings & Decisions
- The 120 vs 123 epoch discrepancy is entirely due to PPO’s 4,096-step rollout constraint; logging the planned budget alongside the overrun provides the necessary audit trail without altering learning behaviour.
- Evaluation traces were accurate aside from the terminal reset snapshot; capturing date in the environment metadata ensures future episodes stay chronologically sound even if the env resets mid-loop.
- Dependency management needs attention—without the training environment activated, evaluation/report scripts cannot run, so we deferred regeneration until the RL stack is available.

## Future Plans
1. In the evaluation pipeline, render portfolio valuation curves per run (annotate the peak NAV and save the graphic under the run directory).
2. Design an inference phase that loads checkpoints to manage an existing live portfolio state without resetting holdings or cash.
3. Recreate the training environment (install stable_baselines3, pytest, etc.), rerun scripts.evaluate, and capture the refreshed traces under version-controlled artifacts.
4. Backfill regression tests that assert evaluation CSVs are strictly monotonic in date now that the date field is available.

## Summary
- Training runs now log planned vs actual timesteps with explicit rollout-overrun messaging, clarifying PPO cadence.
- Evaluation traces consume explicit trading dates so the deterministic CSVs stay chronological, and the existing episode file was cleaned accordingly.
- Next up: restore the RL environment, add valuation visualisations, and stand up an inference-oriented execution path.
