## Focus
Kick off project planning for multi-stock RL trader; capture architecture, checklists, and working rituals.

## Progress
- Reviewed legacy drafts in `sample_code/env.py` and `sample_code/models.py` to understand prior assumptions.
- Drafted project plan detailing scope, milestones, and deliverables.
- Documented target architecture covering data, env, agent, training, evaluation, and experiment utilities.
- Authored project checklist and agent operating checklist to guide execution.
- Created diary scaffold for ongoing session logging.

## Findings & Decisions
- Existing environment code tightly couples plotting and state tracking; plan to rewrite with clean frictions abstraction.
- Models module assumes Stable-Baselines3 ensemble loop; will preserve agent factory concept but simplify orchestration.
- Need explicit data schema validation before any training work.

## Next Steps
1. Define concrete data schema document and validation tests.
2. Sketch new environment API with friction hooks and reward shaping.
3. Scaffold `src/` package and logging utilities.

## Afternoon Update
- Configured `configs/base.yaml` to encode TVT splits, window params, and categorical fallback tokens.
- Implemented `SlidingWindowDataset` for per-window normalization, log-return targets, and config-driven splits.
- Documented windowed preprocessing strategy in `docs/data_pipeline.md` and noted `industry` fallback token in the data profile.
- Generated dataset summary (train=41,360 windows, val=2,726, test=141) as a sanity check.
